WriteOnly
=========

I found a datasheet by Signetics that describes write only memory, but I couldn't find a place to buy the chip, so I made my own implementation for an FPGA. The Quartus II project file is included, since I wrote this and programmed it to my Altera DE1 dev board.

Definitely make sure to take a look at the datasheet...










(A note to those without a sense of humor or digital design knowledge: yes, this is a joke).
